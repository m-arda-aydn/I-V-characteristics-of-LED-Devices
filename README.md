# I-V-characteristics-of-LED-Devices
Cleaning and sorting the data, and producing I-V graphics
Data shows the I-V characteristics of an array of LED devices. Every voltage sweep includes a reverse sweep as well.
I created a new dataset txt file (AI_Dataset1_edited.txt) by deleting the last four experimental values of the original file (AI_Dataset1.txt). This is the only difference between the original file and the edited file.
